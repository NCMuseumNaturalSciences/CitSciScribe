            <p>Welcome to CitSciScribe!</p>
            <p>Since 1879, the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences has documented the biodiversity of the southeastern U.S. and beyond. This incredible record of the region’s natural history has powerful applications for research, conservation, and education. However, much of this potential remains hidden away in historic written records.</p>
            <p>Join us! Become a Citizen Science Curator and unlock these hidden treasures. As you transform written records into a digital format you will make this valuable information available to anyone, anywhere in the world.</p>
